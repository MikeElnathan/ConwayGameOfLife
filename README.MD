Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state without requiring further input. The "game" takes place on an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead.

Rules:
The state of each cell in the grid evolves over discrete time steps (generations) based on the following four rules:

Underpopulation:

A living cell with fewer than 2 living neighbors dies (from loneliness).
Overpopulation:

A living cell with more than 3 living neighbors dies (from overcrowding).
Survival:

A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors survives to the next generation.
Reproduction:

A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors becomes a live cell (as if by reproduction).
Key Concepts:
Neighbors: A cell's neighbors are the 8 cells adjacent to it (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
Grid: The game is typically played on a finite or infinite grid.
Generation: Each step in the game is called a "generation," where all cells update simultaneously according to the rules.
Starting Configuration:
The game's initial configuration (the pattern of living and dead cells) completely determines its evolution. It can lead to:

Stable patterns (e.g., "block" or "beehive").
Oscillators (patterns that repeat periodically, like the "blinker").
Spaceships (patterns that translate across the grid, like the "glider").
Chaotic or infinite growth (some patterns grow indefinitely).
Despite the simplicity of the rules, the Game of Life exhibits complex and emergent behaviors, making it a widely studied example in mathematics, computer science, and theoretical biology.
